## 🔧 Technical Details

### File Structure
```
Website 2/
├── admin/              # CMS admin interface
├── _posts/             # Blog post markdown files
├── _data/              # Generated JSON data
├── images/uploads/     # Uploaded media
├── blog.html           # Blog index page
├── post.html           # Individual post template
├── build-blog.js       # Build script
└── package.json        # Dependencies
```

### How It Works

1. **Write:** Admin interface saves markdown files to `_posts/`
2. **Build:** Netlify runs `build-blog.js` on each deploy
3. **Convert:** Script converts markdown → JSON in `_data/`
4. **Display:** React components read JSON and render posts

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```
